Automation System is developed in C# and integrated with an SQL database. Upon launch, users are greeted by a Login page, requiring a username and password, with additional options for Forgot Password, Register, and Login buttons. The Main Page features options such as Add Personnel, List Personnel, Departments, Salary Increases, Bonuses, Add Overtime, and List Overtime.
In the List Personnel section, existing personnel can be viewed and filtered by ID, name, surname, and start date. Additionally, personnel can be deleted or updated. The Departments section allows for the addition of new departments, updating existing information, or deleting departments. Salary Increases can be applied as a percentage or a fixed amount. The Bonuses section enables adding new bonuses, viewing them in a separate page, and performing payment, updating, deletion, or period change operations. In the Overtime section, added overtime can be viewed, along with payment processing, deletion, and updating options.
